			<img src="images/image1.jpg" border=5 width="600" alt=" the untamed main leads" align="left"/><h2>Plot of The Untamed</h2><p align="justify"><font size="4px">16 years in the past, the jianghu world is ruled by the powerful Wen sect, which dominates over the smaller Lan, Jiang, Nie and Jin sects. The cheerful, mischievous, carefree Wei Wuxian, adoptive son of the Jiang clan, becomes fast friends with the righteous and duty-minded Lan Wangji during an educational seminar hosted every year at the Lan clan's compound. Things become complicated when, during their adventures, the pair find out that the head of the Wen sect is the evil mastermind behind a series of plots that would wreak havoc upon the lands.<br><br>In the present, Wei Wuxian is universally reviled as a practitioner of the dark arts; despite having been presumed dead for almost 16 years, he is portrayed as a vicious, bloodthirsty monster. Mo Xuanyu, the badly-abused nephew of the Mo clan head and the only cultivator in his otherwise mundane clan, uses a dark ritual to summon the spirit of Wei Wuxian into his own body and bind him with a curse that forces Wei Wuxian to punish Mo Xuanyu's enemies. While Wei Wuxian struggles to figure out what has happened in the world since his death and complete his curse-enforced mission, he ends up encountering Lan Wangji. The two work together to solve a series of murder mysteries, eventually finding and defeating the true culprit.<br><br>The drama was actually a manhwa adaptation of the name <i>"Mo Dao Zhu Shi"</i>
In the Web Series, the Qishan Wen Sect invented Demonic Cultivation;Wei Wuxian merely became exceptionally proficient in it. The Fierce Corpses, likewise, were not truly dead but more of a soulless state called "puppetry."Wei Wuxian met Wen Ning and Wen Qing while studying at the Cloud Recesses, rather than an archery competition and as a fugitive, respectively. Wei Wuxian also encountered Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan while both were alive, and expressed interest in the fact that Xiao Xingcheng was from the same sect as his mother. 

In comparison to the Novel, Wei Wuxian's relationship with Lan Wangji became significantly deeper during their youth, from the time both promised Lan Yi that they would work to seal all pieces of Yin Metal. Rather than leave the Cloud Recesses early, Wei Wuxian ran off to accompany Lan Wangji on his journey to investigate the whereabouts of the Yin Metal fragments. Their resulting journey quickly brought them into contact with the Goddess Statue, Nie Mingjue, and Xue Yang. <br><br>

During the Sunshot Campaign's battle at Nightless City, Wei Wuxian was strangled by Wen Ruohan following his use of the Stygian Tiger Seal. Jin Guangyao ultimately killed Wen Ruohan to save Wei Wuxian, instead of Nie Mingjue.

Overall, many of Wei Wuxian's darker actions in the novel were attributed to other characters in the Web Series. At the Bloodbath of Nightless City, Wei Wuxian fought because he knew the Qishan Wen Sect remnants had already been killed, and, once he attempted to stop the fight, a second flute player commenced the bloodbath. Ultimately, Wei Wuxian discovered that Su She and Jin Guangyao were responsible for this, as well as the deaths of Jin Zixuan and Jin Zixun.

Wei Wuxian's death occurred at the Bloodbath of Nightless City, rather than in the First Siege of the Burial Mounds. He attempted to throw himself off a cliff, only to be caught by Lan Wangji. When Jiang Cheng approached and failed to stab his brother, Wei Wuxian seized the chance to fall.

Smaller changes included that Wei Wuxian's resurrection into Mo Xuanyu's body was sixteen years later, as opposed to thirteen. Additionally, the ritual transformed Mo Xuanyu's features to resemble Wei Wuxian's, prompting him to require a mask.<br><br></font></p>

A few days later, Wei Wuxian was alarmed to find Jiang Cheng missing after he had ventured out to the market. He returned to Lotus Pier, presuming his sworn brother had attempted to return for his parents' bodies. Fortunately, Wen Ning had also arrived at Lotus Pier, and quickly offered to help Wei Wuxian recover the captured Jiang Cheng. Wen Ning then smuggled the two fugitives back to his sister's supervisory office in Yiling. Wen Qing was infuriated by her brother's recklessness, but she agreed to help Jiang Cheng for a few days while Wen Chao was away. However, Jiang Cheng awoke to confess that his Golden Core had been melted by Wen Zhuliu, believing his life was worthless if he could not cultivate. Aware that Wen Qing had once written a paper theorizing on golden core transplantations, Wei Wuxian pled with her to transfer his own golden core into Jiang Cheng. Although she warned him that the chances of the operation working were only fifty-percent, she reluctantly agreed. Not wanting his brother to feel poorly upon learning the truth,Wei Wuxian told Jiang Cheng that he recalled how to find his mother's teacher, Baoshan Sanren, and that Baoshan Sanren could restore golden cores. He then directed Jiang Cheng up a mountain, where Wen Qing and Wen Ning spent a two days and a night extracting Wei Wuxian's golden core and implanting it into Jiang Cheng. Because of the high risk of damaging his golden core, Wei Wuxian was awake without anesthetic the entire time. <br><br>

Wei Wuxian waited in a small village for Jiang Cheng to return, but upon entering a teashop, quickly realized something was amiss. He was caught by Wen Zhuliu, but when Wen Chao and Wang Lingjiao expressed a desire to torture him, Wei Wuxian taunted them with the possibility that he would haunt them as a vicious ghost. Disconcerted, Wen Chao elected to severely beat Wei Wuxian before throwing him into the Yiling Burial Mounds, warning him that no one had ever been able to escape before. For the next three months, Wei Wuxian took to refining his original idea to harness resentful energy for power without a golden core. He crafted a flute Chenqing to use music to control Fierce Corpses and other demonic creatures, and invented the beginnings of the Spirit-Attraction Flag through reversing the script on typical spirit-suppressing talismans, using human blood as ink.</font></p>

Wang Lingjiao soon arrived at Lotus Pier, arresting their sixth shidi on trumped charges of ill intent towards the Qishan Wen Sect. When Yu Ziyuan spoke with her, Wang Lingjiao announced that she had come to punish Wei Wuxian for 'distracting' Wen Chao while he killed the Tortoise of Slaughter. Yu Ziyuan initially seemed to comply, beating Wei Wuxian with Zidian while Jiang Cheng begged her to stop. Although she claimed that Wei Wuxian would not be able to heal for a month, Wang Lingjiao insisted that Yu Ziyuan cut off his hand. <br><br>As Jiang Cheng pled with his mother, Yu Ziyuan ordered her maids Jinzhu and Yinzhu to close the doors. As Wang Lingjiao delightedly informed Yu Ziyuan that Lotus Pier would become the Qishan Wen Sect's new supervisory office in Yunmeng, Wei Wuxian was resigned to losing his hand to keep peace.To everyone's astonishment, Yu Ziyuan then slapped Wang Lingjiao. Jinzhu and Yinzhu quickly slaughtered the rest of the Qishan Wen Sect cultivators, but as Yu Ziyuan prepared to kill Wang Lingjiao, Wen Zhuliu rushed in to protect her. In the resulting fight, Wang Lingjiao fired off Signal Firelights to summon many members of the Qishan Wen Sect to LOtus Pier. Yu Ziyuan dragged Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng to a boat and bound them with Zidian. She ordered them not to return to Lotus Pier, to flee to her Meishan Yu Sect to find Jiang Yanli, and requested that Wei Wuxian protect Jiang Cheng with his life. As the boys were sent away, she returned to prepare for battle. As they drifted in the current, the returning Jiang Fengmian encountered the two. Although he initially removed Zidian, upon hearing the name of Wen Zhuliu, he rebound the two and again ordered Wei Wuxian to protect Jiang Cheng. When the two finally managed to return to Lotus Pier, they found their entire sect massacred. As they overhead Wen Chao console Wang Lingjiao that both Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan were dead. In despair, Jiang Cheng attempted to choke Wei Wuxian, demanding to know why he had tried to defend Lan Wangji and Jin Zixuan in the cave of the Tortoise of Slaughter. Eventually, however, both boys cried and began to make their way to Meishan.</font></p><br><br>
